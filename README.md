This is me trying out Progressive Web App by following along the [Google's PWA Training video series]()

## How To run the App

* Run a web server. You can use simple localhost like this: `python -m http.server 8000`
* Access it from a browser [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000?target=_blank)
